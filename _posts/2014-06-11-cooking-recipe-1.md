I'm trying lately to bring some variety in my everyday life by getting out of my comfort zone. This photo post is about cooking and particularly a recipe which I found in a magazine. I don't normally cook anything which has more than 3-4 steps of preparation, so this one was a serious challenge. It turned out to be very delicious at the end. And of course it took me a lot of time, due to lack of experience in the kitchen lol.

Since I did not stick exactly to the original recipe, I will give you the slightly updated version which I have actually did. Is is just a little bit simpler and includes ingredients which you can find easily.

- 4-5 small potatoes
- 300g cream, try to find one which is not like liquid but thicker
- 200g grated cheese, you can also grate it yourself if you want
- 100g ham
- 1 egg, if you love eggs, you can fit up to 3, but I prefer using just one
- 20-30g herb butter, normal one also works fine
- a little olive oil
- salt, pepper
- a little bit fresh or frozen chives

The whole preparation can be divided into 3 major tasks - preparing the potatoes, preparing the filling and the cooking plate and baking in the oven. I will shortly describe each of them in the following paragraphs.

### Preparing the potatoes

Wash the potatoes thoroughly and put them in a cooking pot. Fill it with water so that it covers the potatoes. Please notice that you **do not peel** them! If you peel them, they will suck too much water and you will have serious trouble cutting them afterwards. Now you have to boil the water with the potatoes and when it starts boiling reduce the heating at half strength.

Wait for about 20 minutes and then get the potatoes out of the pot and leave them to cool down for a while. After they are cool enough so that you could touch them with bare hands, you need to peel them. This should be easy and I suggest using only your hands and no tools for this. When you're done peeling, cut them into slices and put them in a plate.

Next you need to heat up a little bit olive oil in a pan and fry the potato slices just a little bit. Do not fry them too much cause you will put them in the oven later and you do not want them to get too dry at the end. Just make sure they have a little bit of brown around the edges on both sides.

When you're done with the frying, put the fried potato slices on a kitchen paper so that you get rid of the excessive olive oil. Once you're done with that you can go to the next step.

### Preparing the cooking plate and filling
It cannot be simpler than that - you just need to cover the whole cooking plate with a thin film of butter so that nothing gets stuck to it  later when you bake everything together.

Next, you need to put the fried potato slices aroung the edge of the plate so that they form a kind of wall. To fill all the gaps in the "wall", you then put slices of ham on the inner side.

Congratulations, you have prepared the bed for the filling! All you need to do now is prepare the filling mixture itself. It consists of cheese, cream and a little bit salt and pepper. You can just put evething in a bowl and mix it together.

After you are done preparing the filling mixture, you just pour it inside the bed in the cooking plate and put an egg on top of it. You should also cover the potatoes and the ham with a little bit of cheese.

### Baking
Now you can put the cooking plate in the oven and bake it at 200ÂºC. Make sure you have top and bottom heater on.

</figure>

After about 15-20 minutes it should be ready. Basically, when the egg gets hard, and all the cheese on the potatoes and the ham has melted, it means that it is ready. Get it out of the oven.

Finally, you can cover it with the fresh chives to give it that extra good look and taste.
