Last week on Thursday it was an official holiday in Germany - Father's day as well. I got an offer from a friend to go out take some photos. Although the weather was not as sunny as I wish it would be on a holiday, at least it did not rain while we were outside. 

I love my neighbourhood and the surroundings, cause everything is really green and one can enjoy long walks, jogging or bike tours as if this place is somewhere far away from the big city. Since the planned photo walk was in my surroudings I just had to take a short walk to our meeting point. I have managed to take two quick shots on my way there.

While I was taking the photo of the stairs (sun was there for just a couple of seconds) standing down on my knees, I have noticed something interesting on the wall next to me. The whole stone wall was completely covered by soft moss. I decided to try and capture the wild patterns which it formed when I saw one of the tiny inhabitants of this place - a small snail hidden in its shell, stuck to the wall. Good that I had my other camera with me and could take a proper macro shot.

After I managed to find my friend at the meeting point, we took a long walk and finally sat down to relax and get a beer. As proper smartphone addict, I have immediately pulled it out of my pocket to check for new stuff. After gathering shortly some inspiration from friends on Instagram I noticed something interesting in the garden we were in and had to post it.

We have finished our beers and headed down to the river side, where I have decided to try out my building skills by making a small rock tower. As it turned out, this is not easy at all and it kept on collapsing every time after I had put the 4th rock. After putting some more effort in the construction and failing misarably I decided to put some more thought and find a solution - So I managed to find flatter rocks which were staying more stable and finally had my small tower. I took a couple of shots being proud of my creation.

At the end of the walk I have noticed some rusty lock and chains which held a gate closed. Shooting from a lower angle has allowed me to capture the cloudy sky in the background and some soft light coming through the tree leaves.

Although I was pretty skeptical about taking any nice shots in this weather, I managed to take 5 which I really liked. There is no bad weather which could break you inspiration to take beautiful shots, so don't let this be an excuse for not going out and enjoying the day.
