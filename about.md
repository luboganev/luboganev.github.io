The main project I work on is the IULearn Android application focused on learning and practising. It's a rich media application with powerful features like course scripts with annotations, self-testing tools, and multimedia content to help students prepare for exams. The app uses an innovative cross-platform web approach to share code across Android, iOS and Web. Students can download content for offline use and seamlessly sync their progress across all devices when online, allowing them to transition smoothly between studying at home and on the go.

The app was built from scratch in just 9 months, achieving remarkable stability metrics with a user-perceived crash rate of only 0.35% and an ANR (Application Not Responding) rate of 0.01%. This technical excellence is reflected in the app's superb Google Play Store rating, maintaining a 4.4+ lifetime rating from users.
