Hello, my name is Lyubomir and I am an experienced Android applications developer. Through my career I have worked in different areas of software development. I have initally started with desktop applications, then moved to fullstack web development and finally settled in the mobile applications domain. I actively keep myself up to date with the latest software trends and enjoy trying out new approaches and technologies. I spend my free time doing calisthenics, dancing salsa or taking photos.

If you would like to take a deep dive into technical topics, you can check out my [__Posts__]({{ site.url }}/posts). You can also find an overview of some of my work in the following projects sections below. For further details, check my profiles on some popular web platforms by following the links in the footer.


# _Professional projects_

### IU International University
IU International University is the largest university in Europe's DACH region with over 100,000 registered students. Its mission is to provide students with the best personalised education to grow. In addition IU offers all the studies online so students can study from anywhere anytime. All of this contributes to a rich and challenging technological environment for IT innovation.

One of the projects I work on is the IU Learn Android application focused on learning and practising. It's a rich media application which includes course scripts with powerful annotations and self-test features, as well as audio and videos content to help students prepare better for their exams. Some of those features are implemented through a unique cross platform web based approach allowing sharing of code and content across Android, iOS and Web applications. The most powerful feature of the app is the ability to download what you need and just go offline without missing any of the tools. The app also seamlessly synchronises all its data across platforms when online, since users very often use more than one device and platform. This allows students to start learning at home on their laptop desktop or tablet, and then pick up exactly from what they left off on their smaller mobile devices while on the go.

### Startup in the automotive domain
An Internet of Things startup based in Munich, Germany. Main focus are mobile payments for fuel and making cars smarter through additional periphery and cloud sevices.

Unfortunately during the war in Ukraine in 2022 the company has demonstrated a lack of judgment and decency by exploiting it for self-serving PR campaigns and publicity. I was not part of the company at that time but I am truly ashamed I contributed before that moment to such an organization, therefore I would not publicly announce its name or make any advertisement for it.

# _Private projects_

### App rating calculator
The app rating calculator is a tool I always wanted to have, when trying to bump up the lifetime average app rating in Google Play. Its purpose is to illustrate how much effort and how many new positive ratings would it take to compensate for the impact of negative ratings in the past. You can use the app [Here](https://luboganev.dev/app-rating-calc), or check out the code in the [Repository](https://github.com/luboganev/app-rating-calc). 

This is a project I have built in order to learn TypeScript and Vue.js. PRs with improvements are welcome :)

### Cyberpunk breach protocol
