Hello, my name is Lyubomir and I am a software engineer. I love mobile development and particularly Android. Through the years I have worked in different areas of the software development - from desktop applications, through backend and frontend web development and finally landing in the mobile domain. I always enjoy trying out new stuff and do some programming during my free time. My other hobbies are photography and latin dances. When I am not coding you could meet me walking down the city streets searching for that perfect shot or dancing my shoes off at the local salsa club.

If you are interested in the stuff I do for fun or profit just look around the website, for example starting at the blog or the projects section. Further, you can find me on various other websites by just visiting the links at the bottom of the page.
