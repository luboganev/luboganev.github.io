Hello, my name is Lyubomir and I am an experienced Android applications developer. Through my career I have worked in different areas of software development. I have initally started with desktop applications, then moved to fullstack web development and finally settled in the mobile applications domain. I actively keep myself up to date with the latest software trends and enjoy trying out new approaches and technologies. I spend my free time doing calisthenics, dancing salsa or taking photos.

If you would like to take a deep dive into technical topics, you can check out my [__Blog__]({{ site.url }}/blog). You can also find an overview of some of my work in the following projects sections below. For further details, check my profiles on some popular web platforms by following opening the links in the footer.
