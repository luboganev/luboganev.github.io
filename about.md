# _Professional projects_

### IU International University (Jan 2022 - present)
IU International University is the largest university in Europe's DACH region with over 140,000 registered students. Its mission is to provide students with the best personalised education to grow. In addition IU offers all the studies online so students can study from anywhere anytime. All of this contributes to a rich and challenging technological environment for IT innovation.

##### 2023 - currently
myCampus app is the native variant of International University's online platfrom. It was built as the next iteration of the cross-platform technical solution using all the know how that we have accumulated during the development of IULearn. My main tasks and achievements are:

- Architected and developed fully native app features in addition to the platform development.
- Implemented a technical solution enabling the native app to host and serve SPA micro frontends from local files, thus enabling shared codebase between the native app and the SPA micro frontend based web platform
- Implemented a "Dev mode" containing numerous tools that facilitate the work of micro frontend web developers to build for both web and native app platforms.
- Contributed cross-team via inner sourcing to micro frontends based on vue.js and TypeScript.
- Collaborated closely with the Design and UX team developing a rich fully custom design system and implementing it in Android Jetpack Compose

##### 2022 - 2023

### Startup in the automotive domain  (Mar 2019 - Dec 2021)
An Internet of Things startup based in Munich, Germany. Main focus are mobile payments for fuel and making cars smarter through additional periphery and cloud sevices.

This role is not listed by name due to a values misalignment with the organization. I was not employed there during the events in question but have opted not to publicly associate with the company.

The challenging project allowed me to step up significantly my skills. Here is a list of my tasks:

- Adopted Kotlin multiplatform SDK for iOS and Android handling communication with complex state machine at the BE, thus significantly reducing the time to launch for both platforms.
- Architected and implemented multi-layer multi-module architecture for BE communication, domain layer and UI layer, improving significantly build times.
- Implemented mock BE with Kotlin Multiplatform used for automated and manual testing of all possible BE state transitions, thus enabling the development of both iOS and Android apps to be done in parallel with the BE development. This enabled us to successfully launch despite coding until the very last minute.
- Designed and implemented modular custom design system layer in close collaboration with UX and UI designers.
- Adopted Jetpack Compose as the main Andorid UI framework
- Led a team of two senior developers and cross-collaborated with BE engineers, UX/UI designers and product managers.
