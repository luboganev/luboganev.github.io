Spontacts is a social community which allows members to find, participate and create numerous activities at a certain location and particular time. Through participating in activities with other community members during their free time, Spontacts members can find and contact new interesting people, who share common interests and look for interesting activities during their free time. Over a period of two months I have worked together with the in-house team on a couple of new features integrated in the native Android app. For more information visit the [__Spontacts__](https://www.spontacts.com/) website or check out the Android app at [__Google Play__](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.conceptworks.spontacts)
